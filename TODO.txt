TODO list :

1. main : move charge, phi, psi, sigma, s, phi_eps, fx  to module "ddcosmo"
   ----
   ---> FL: I disagree. Keeping these quantities separated is consistent with
            the idea of a driver + module implementation, where all the quantities
            that either depend on the solute or are used to assemble other quantities
            are kept external. 
         
          restructure as :  read_control_file()
                            reset_ngrid( igrid )
                            read_molecule_file()
                            ----- modify centers and radii for dubugging HERE -----
                            ddinit()
                            .
                            .
                            .
                            memfree()

2. ddcosmo : eliminate read_x,y,z,r,q ; use csph, rsph, charge instead
   -------
             add charge,phi,psi,sigma,s,phi_eps,fx ; add esolv ??? Discuss about it

   ---> FL: These two modifications, together with everything else concerning with the
            coordinates/charges, are in contrast with what I suggest at point 1.

             use ngrid as over-integration flag ? Discuss about it  ---> ???

             read_molecule_file() : add allocation of charge, csph, rsph ; read into charge, csph, rsph

             ddinit() : add missing allocations ; remove read_x,y,z,r,q

             memfree() : add missing deallocations ; remove read_x,y,z,r,q

             fsw : remove s,eta from head   ---> sure

             dfsw : remove s,eta from head  ---> sure

             wghpot : why is there a minus sign ??? add comment about it --- there is a minus sign in the equations

             adjrhs1 : check consistency of extension with direct problem

3. mkrhs : modify accordingly to restructuring of ddcosmo
   -----

4. debug : modify all allocations/allocations according to the modifications in ddcosmo
   -----

5. compute_forces/forces : remove everything from head, add a general redirecting routine, depending
   ---------------------   on iscrf flag       
  
   ---> FL: but for the quantities that relate to the solute or are to be used in a subsequent calculation

6. matvec : lx,lstarx : why sign flip ??? add comment about it ---> will do. it has to do with the fact that
                        calcv assembles minus the matrix, i.e., what is to be added to the RHS in a jacobi-like iteration...
   ------
                           
7. iefpcm : move mrkvec,(mkrvec_fmm),adjvec,mkprec,adjprec somewhere else ( ddcosmo ? ) ; eventually remove
   ------
            mrkvec : review extension ( transition layer missing ) ; remove eps_s, xlm, x from head ( discuss )

            adjvec : review whole routine
