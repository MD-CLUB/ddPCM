\section{Numerical Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
\subsection{Convergence tests}
We first verify the implementation of the computation of the forces.
Let us denote by $	\mathcal{F}_{i,\alpha}$ the $\alpha$-component of the force  $	\mathcal{F}_{i}$ for $\alpha=1,2,3$. Let $e_\alpha$ be the canonical unit vectors of $\mathbb R^3$.
Then, for any atomic position $x_i$ we consider a sequence $\delta_1,\delta_2,\ldots$ and consider the approximate force obtained by finite difference
\[
	\mathcal{F}_{i,\alpha}
	\approx
	\mathcal{F}_{i,\alpha}(\delta_n)
	= 
	\frac{E_s(x_1,\ldots,x_i + \delta_n e_\alpha,\ldots,x_M) - E_s(x_1,\ldots,x_i,\ldots,x_M)}{\delta_n},
\]
where we have made explicit the dependency of the solvation energy on the nuclear positions.

In table \ref{tab:}, we illustrate the RMS of the approximate forces with $\delta_n = x^{-n}$ 
for caffeine.

\subsection{Timings}
Timings for different molecular structures depending on the number of atoms (i.e. alanine chains, hemoglobin, etc).
