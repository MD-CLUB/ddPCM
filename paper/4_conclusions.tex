\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
%We presented a discretization of the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) based on a domain decomposition strategy that we call ddPCM. The model is consistent with the recently introduced ddCOSMO algorithm in the sense that the ddPCM provides the same energy as the ddCOSMO for large dielectric constants and identical discretization parameters. 
%Further the method is systematically improvable and provides smooth energy profiles with respect to changes in the nuclear coordinates.
%The method is based on two steps, the first one being completely new developments and the second one relying on the already developed ddCOSMO-machinery. 
%
%The task of providing an efficient discretization of the PCM is more difficult than for the COSMO and a linear scaling has not yet been achieved. 
%However, the proposed method allows in principle a fast linear scaling implementation but this is subject of future investigations as it requires additional substantial developments.
